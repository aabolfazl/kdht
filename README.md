# DHT KernelSpace Routing with Userspace Storage(Rust)

## Overview

This project implements a **Distributed Hash Table (DHT)** using a split architecture: **routing logic** in the kernel space and **storage functionality** in userspace. This design allows efficient packet routing directly in the kernel while leveraging Rust in userspace for safe, flexible data management.

## Concept

Using a **Kademlia-based DHT**, the kernel module manages node discovery, routing, and packet forwarding based on an XOR distance metric, allowing efficient data lookup across distributed nodes. The kernel handles the DHTâ€™s routing independently, guiding requests through the network to locate data on other nodes when necessary.

If a request arrives for data stored locally, the kernel module calls on a Rust-based userspace application to manage the data storage and retrieval. This separation allows clients to seamlessly locate data within the DHT without implementing their own DHT logic.

## Key Components

1. **Kernel space (Routing)**: The kernel module intercepts packets, manages the DHT routing table, and uses XOR-based lookups to route requests across the network.

2. **Userspace (Storage)**: The Rust application in userspace handles data storage for locally-responsible keys, supporting the kernel's routing layer without interfering with routing logic.

## Benefits

- **High Performance**: Kernel-level routing minimizes latency in DHT lookups.
- **Modularity**: Decoupling routing and storage allows each layer to scale or improve independently.
- **Safety**: Rust in userspace ensures safe, concurrent data handling for reliable storage management.

This project provides a robust, modular DHT implementation with efficient routing and safe, manageable storage, suited for distributed data access without centralization.
